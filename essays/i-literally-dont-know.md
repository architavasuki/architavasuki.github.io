<div class="content">
  <h1>I Literally Don't Know</h1>

  <p class="tldr"><strong>TL;DR:</strong> You don't need to pick my brain, or probably anyone's brain, for general life advice. It won't help.</p>

  <p>When people ask me for life advice, I almost never know what to say. The list of things I do know is much shorter than the list of things I don't know, and one thing I definitely don't know is what other people should do with their lives. And so, when I receive an email from someone asking:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If [X] company is good, and if they should work there</li>
    <li>If [Y] person is good, and if they should work with them</li>
    <li>If I could jump on a call with them so they can pick my brain because they are figuring out what to do with their life</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Well, I often wish I could reply with the title of this essay.</p>
