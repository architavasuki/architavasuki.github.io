  <h1>what's leverage?</h1>

  <!-- <p class="tldr"><strong>TL;DR:</strong> You don't need to pick my brain, or probably anyone's brain, for general life advice. It won't help.</p> -->

  <p>Leverage, in general, is anything that allows you to multiply the output of your efforts without a corresponding increase in inputs. Historically, leverage came in the form of labor — you’d hire people to work for you. Then came capital — money working for you. But both of those are permissioned leverage. You need someone’s approval: an investor, an employer, a government.</p>

  <p>To give it shape: if you were a laborer in the past, your output was tied directly to your hours. If you were a capitalist, your money made money for you. Now, if you're a coder or a builder, your code makes value for you. It’s a lever. You write a smart contract, a website, an automation script, or an AI model — and it keeps running. The internet distributes it globally at no cost. Open-source communities iterate on it. It becomes a self-replicating organism in the digital ecosystem.
  </p>

  <p>Even better, unlike labor and capital, which require permission — to hire, to deploy, to raise funds — code doesn’t ask for permission. You can sit in your bedroom, write software, deploy it, and suddenly you’re competing with billion-dollar institutions.

  <p>so, become an expert at your craft, code and sell - care about it, show it to people</p>
